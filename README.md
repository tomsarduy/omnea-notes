## Notes

I spent a bit over 2 hours on this because it was the first time I use this stack. 
Spent most time checking the Matetial UI docs than in the actual implementation though :D

## Run

    git clone
    yarn
    yarn run dev

## Used

NextJS + Typescript + Apollo + MatetialUI

## Todo:

- Add unit tests (React Testing Library)
- Define a better layout
- Improve types
- Add features
